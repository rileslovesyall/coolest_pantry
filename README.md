# Pocket Pantry UI

This is the front end code for the [pocket pantry][1] website. 

Do you preserve food at home? Are you comforted by rows of jars lining your pantry 
shelves, or filling your freezer? Do you ever lose track of what all you have in the 
midst of such plenty? 

Welcome to Pocket Pantry. You can easily track all of your preserved goods, with their 
ingredients and expiration dates, get weekly reminders of what 
needs to be eaten soon, and see at a glance what you have available. 

To get started, create a new item, including it's ingredients, and how long it takes 
(from the date it was made) to expire. You can include an initial quantity when you log 
your first item, if you have any in stock. You can set the portion sizes your item is 
preserved in, like 'cups,' 'pints,' 'quarts,' or whatever size you'd like. Each time you 
use that amount, you can log it using the 'consume' button on the item page. 

In the future, you'll be able to see a visualization of when you've consumed your items, 
giving you more data to plan your future food needs. 

Whenever you make more of the same item, just use the 'add' button on the item page, 
and the new quantity will immediately be added to your pantry with the proper expiration date.

On the 'My Account' tab, you can edit your notification settings. By default, you will be 
sent a weekly e-mail listing any items expiring in the next two weeks, as well as a list 
of all the items in your current pantry. You're welcome to turn off these e-mails, as well as 
change what you deem as 'expiring soon.' (Want to see everything that expires in the next month? 
Just change that setting to '4 weeks' instead of the default 2!)
