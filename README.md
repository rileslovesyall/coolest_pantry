# Pocket Pantry UI

This is the front end code for the [pocket pantry][1] website. 

Do you preserve food at home? Are you comforted by rows of jars lining your pantry 
shelves, or filling your freezer? Do you ever lose track of what all you have in the 
midst of such plenty? 

Welcome to Pocket Pantry. Easily track your preserved goods with their ingredients and expiration dates, get weekly reminders of what needs to be eaten soon, & see at a glance what's available.
